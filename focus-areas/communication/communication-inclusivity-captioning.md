## Question

**Question:**  Do we provide text captioning for spoken communication?


## 1. Description

Is captioning needed for spoken communication? To cover as wide as a net as possible to our users I believe so as language barriers and comprehension must be taken into account. If we are able to provide captioning than it should be so.

## 2. Sample Objectives

Provide a caption alternative for spoken communication
Way to measure the effectiveness of providing a caption
No misinterpretation in caption/translation


## 3. Sample Strategies

Standard of translation/caption is as close to orgin as possible
Feedback from users on how effective and useful they  found it to be


## 4. Sample Success Metrics
_Qualitative_

Provide a standar for caption
feedback survey
